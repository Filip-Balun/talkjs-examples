# Getting Started with the react example app

This project is designed to demonstrate how you can easily add chat in to your React application using [TalkJS](https://talkjs.com)

First you'll need to enter your own `appId` inside the `App.js` component. You can find your `appId` in the [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard)

To run the example, run `yarn start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
